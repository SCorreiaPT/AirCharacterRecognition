# Over the Air Character Recognition [AirChar IMU Data Acquisition and Augmentation]

This repository contains the workflow used to **acquire**, **store**, and **augment** inertial data for the _AirChar_ project, focused on **handwritten character recognition in the air** using motion sensors.

---

## Overview

The system is based on an **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**, which includes a built-in **9-axis IMU (LSM9DS1)** capable of measuring 3-axis acceleration and angular velocity.

Data collection, storage, and preprocessing are divided into three main components:

1. **`AirCharLogger.ino`** â€“ Arduino firmware for real-time data acquisition.  
2. **`main.py`** â€“ Python script to download serial data and save it into structured CSV files.  
3. **`dataAug.py` / `main.py`** â€“ Python modules for data augmentation through 3D vector rotations.

---

## 1. Data Acquisition

The Arduino sketch [`AirCharLogger.ino`](./AirCharLogger.ino) configures the IMU and continuously logs:

- **Accelerometer:** `AccX`, `AccY`, `AccZ` (in *m/sÂ²*)  
- **Gyroscope:** `GyrX`, `GyrY`, `GyrZ` (in *Â°/s*)  

Each record corresponds to a single IMU reading captured at **100 Hz**.  
Data is sent via the **serial port** to a host computer.

---

## 2. Data Download and Storage

A Python script (e.g., [`download_data.py`](./download_data.py)) reads the serial output and saves it into a structured CSV file with the following format:

### File naming convention
Each raw sample follows the structure:
A_s01v01n0001p0a0f0.csv
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ fixed metadata
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€ augmentation marker (a0)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ participant posture / position
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ sample number
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ version number
â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ subject ID
â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ recorded character


## 3. Data Augmentation

To improve dataset diversity, a **data augmentation** step is applied using the scripts:

- [`dataAug.py`](./dataAug.py) â€” defines all augmentation routines  
- [`main.py`](./main.py) â€” batch processes all `.csv` files in the `samples/` directory

Each dataset is augmented by applying **3D rotations** of the acceleration and gyroscope vectors around the **X**, **Y**, and **Z** axes, for the following angles:
Â±15Â°, Â±30Â°, Â±45Â°

This results in **18 augmented versions** per original file, simulating different sensor orientations during motion capture.

---

## ðŸ§¾ 4. Output Structure

Augmented files are stored in the folder `samplesAug/`.  
Each one preserves the original metadata header, with the following automatic modifications:

- The line becomes "Augmentation: No" becomes "Augmentation: Yes (x+15)"
where `x` is the rotation axis and `+15` is the applied angle.

- The filename reflects the augmentation, replacing `a0` with the specific axis and angle:  
A_s01v01n0001p0a0f0.csv â†’ A_s01v01n0001p0ax+15f0.csv


Thus, each augmented file remains fully traceable to its source and transformation parameters.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Collect data using Arduino
#    (upload and run AirCharLogger.ino)
# 2. Download and save IMU stream:
python download_data.py
# 3. Run data augmentation:
python main.py
